## 🎯 Overview

This project implements a YOLOv8-based object detection system specifically designed to detect and classify Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in visual data. The model can identify two types of drones:

1. **Multirotor drones** - Traditional quadcopters and multirotor UAVs
2. **Fixed-wing drones** - Fixed-wing aircraft-style UAVs

The system is capable of processing both static images and video streams in real-time, making it suitable for various applications including security, surveillance, and airspace management.

## ✨ Features

- 🚁 **Dual-class detection**: Identifies both multirotor and fixed-wing drones
- 🖼️ **Image processing**: Batch processing of images with detection visualization
- ⚡ **Optimized training**: Mixed precision training with GPU acceleration
- 🔄 **Checkpoint management**: Automatic checkpoint saving and resumption
- 📊 **Comprehensive evaluation**: Detailed metrics and visualization tools

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of approximately 1,360 carefully annotated images of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), collected from diverse sources including online repositories and custom captures. The dataset encompasses two distinct classes of drones: multirotor drones (traditional quadcopters and multirotor UAVs) and fixed-wing drones (aircraft-style UAVs). Each image has been meticulously annotated in YOLO format with bounding box coordinates, ensuring precise localization of the target objects. The images represent a wide variety of real-world scenarios, including different lighting conditions (daylight, dusk, and various weather conditions), diverse backgrounds (urban, rural, and aerial views), multiple viewing angles, and varying scales. This diversity is crucial for training a robust detection model that can generalize well to unseen environments. The dataset maintains a balanced distribution between the two classes, preventing class imbalance issues during training. All annotations follow the YOLO format standard, where bounding box coordinates are normalized to values between 0 and 1, facilitating consistent training across different image resolutions. The dataset structure is organized to support efficient data loading during training, with images and their corresponding annotation files stored in a unified directory structure that the YOLOv8 framework can directly process.

### Dataset Information

- **Total Images**: ~1,360 annotated images
- **Classes**: 2 (drone, Fix-wing-drone)
- **Format**: YOLO format (images with corresponding `.txt` annotation files)
- **Distribution**: Balanced representation of both drone types

### Dataset Structure

### Annotation Format

Each annotation file contains bounding boxes in YOLO format:

```
class_id center_x center_y width height
```

All coordinates are normalized to [0, 1] range.

### Data Configuration

The dataset configuration is specified in `data.yaml`:

```yaml

train: dataset_txt
val: dataset_txt

names:
  0: drone
  1: Fix-wing-drone
```
